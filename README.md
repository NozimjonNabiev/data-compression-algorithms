## Introduction

Data compression is the process of reducing the size of data files while maintaining their integrity and minimizing loss of information. It has a wide range of applications, such as reducing storage requirements, optimizing network bandwidth, and speeding up data transmission.

This repository aims to provide implementations of popular data compression algorithms to serve as educational resources and references for those interested in understanding and exploring the field of data compression.

## Algorithms

The following algorithms are currently implemented in this repository:

- **Huffman**: Huffman coding is a variable-length prefix coding algorithm that assigns shorter codes to frequently occurring symbols and longer codes to less frequent symbols, thereby achieving compression. The implementation includes encoding and decoding functionalities.

- **LZW**: Lempel-Ziv-Welch (LZW) is a dictionary-based compression algorithm that replaces repeated sequences of symbols with shorter codes. It builds a dictionary of commonly occurring patterns on-the-fly during encoding and uses it for decoding. The implementation includes encoding and decoding functionalities.

- **LZ77**: LZ77 is a sliding window-based compression algorithm that replaces repeated sequences of symbols with references to earlier occurrences of the same sequence. It uses a lookahead buffer and a sliding window to search for and encode repeated patterns. The implementation includes encoding and decoding functionalities.

## Usage

To use any of the compression algorithms in this repository, follow the instructions provided in the respective algorithm directories. Each algorithm has its own set of usage instructions, including how to encode and decode files using the algorithm.

Make sure you have the necessary dependencies installed and compatible with your system before running the algorithms. Details about dependencies and compatibility can be found in the algorithm-specific directories.
